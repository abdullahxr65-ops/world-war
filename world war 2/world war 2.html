    <h2>invasion of Normandy:</h2>
    <pre>
Invasion of Normandy  is a series of battles that took place in 1944 between Nazi Germany and Allied forces as part of a major conflict during World War II.
The importance of this battle was the landing of Allied forces in Europe and the direct transfer of the battle against the Germans.
It is the initial part of a campaign divided into several stages, known as the Normandy Campaign.
American and British forces landed on the shores of (Normandy), located in northern France,
in which 6,900 warships <mark>(including 4,100 landing ships)</mark>,
12,000 warplanes, and one million paratroopers and marines participated,
and the operation was led by the American General (Eisenhower), 
and the Allies were able to occupy the beach, then continued towards the city of (Berlin).

<h2>Allied readiness:</h2>
    <pre>
Allied commanders were aware that the Nazis expected the strike to be in Cali, as well as the Normandy region.
In the month before the landing, air attacks had intensified and become permanent, 
and air fleets with their destructive payloads were launching from British bases to strike supply and fuel factories and airports.
This operation was planned by General Eisenhower in 1940, a fifty-two-year-old American lieutenant colonel,
and this plan was in response to an urgent Soviet request to open a front in the west in order to relieve German pressure on the Soviets.
The Allies mobilized three million soldiers for this operation <strong>(1,700,000 American soldiers, while Britain and France were able to gather 1,300,000 soldiers)</strong>
<strong style="color: rgb(193, 114, 10);">The equipment of these forces included 50,000 tanks, trucks, semi-tracked cars, and jeeps</strong>, in addition to two million tons of equipment, seven thousand ships, and 11,000 aircraft.
The Allies also built 163 airports in Britain to support this operation. These forces were led by General Eisenhower, Commander of the Allied Forces

<h2>German readiness:</h2>
    <pre>
In 1944, the Nazis knew that an Allied attack was inevitable, but they did not know when or where it would start.
They believed that the attack would take place from the narrowest area of the Channel on the coast of Cali.
As a result, their strongest forces were concentrated there.
The actual target was one of the best-kept secrets of the war, as the attack would have been along 50 miles of the coast of Normandy It rushes forcefully west of the Orne River to a beach on the Coconta Peninsula,
which is overlooked by the vital port of Cherbourg.
During that period the great power of the Nazi Luftwaffe declined.
The Germans placed obstacles, fortifications, and reinforced concrete, planted millions of mines along the coast, and deployed three armies on the beach, or approximately 1.5 million soldiers,
and these armies were placed under the command of Marshal Rommel <mark style="color: rgb(79, 10, 18);">(the Desert Fox)</mark>.

<h2>Landing on June 6:</h2>
<pre>

The Germans did not expect the landings to begin in June for two reasons.
The first was that the area was extremely frozen, and they expected the offensive to begin in the summer.
The second reason was that the Soviet front was relatively calm, as German intelligence stated that the Normandy landings would not occur unless the Soviets launched a similar, 
major offensive from the east to pressure the German army on both fronts.
General Rommel's plan to confront the Normandy landings was to confront the landings by moving five armored divisions quickly.
It was assumed that they would be able to reach the landing point wherever they happened within a period not exceeding 3 hours from the start of the landings to confront the enemy and throw him into the sea.
 However,based on Hitler's orders, these divisions were stationed far from the shore and their movement was linked directly to Hitler,
 which made Rommel repeat his famous phrase about HitlerWith Hitler, 
the truth is always on the side of the one who says the last word.
The massive operations program scheduled for June 5, 1944, was postponed for one day, due to bad weather conditions, and although expectations...
